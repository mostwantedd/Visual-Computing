Image processing and 2D geometry

For question
 
6.1 just run the script 6_1, it contains the function basic_convolution.If you waht to run with a different kernel just comment the second line and decomment the 3rd one. The script also works for an arbirary (2n+1)×(2m+1) kernel.

6.2 just run the script 6_2, it contains the function extended_convolution. If you waht to run with a different kernel just comment the second line and decomment the 3rd one. The script also works for an arbirary (2n+1)×(2m+1) kernel.

6.3 just run the script 6_3, it contains the function extended_convolution applied for the different kernels required.

6.4 just run the script 6_4, it contains the function extended_convolution and fourier_convolution. It might take a while tor the time analysis to be made.

7.1 just run the script 7_1.
7.2 just run the script 7_2.
7.3 just run the script 7_3.
7.4 just run the script 7_4.

8.1 just run the script 8_1, you need to have picture mona.jpg in the same file.

8.2 just run the script 8_2, you need to have picture mona.jpg in the same file.

8.3 just run the script 8_3, you need to have picture window.jpg in the same file.

8.4 just run the script 8_4, you need to have function 'calchmography' in the same 
folder. You need to have pictures parade1.jpg and parade2.jpg in the same file.

8.5 just run the script 8_5, you need to have function 'calchmography' in the same folder. If you dont waht to repet the steps in 8.4 just load mymatrix.mat and run the second section of the code and then the 3rd section. You need to have pictures parade1.jpg and parade2.jpg in the same file.
